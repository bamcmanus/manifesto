# The Effective Developer Manifesto

**Preface:**

I wanted to share a few principles that I've found particularly helpful during
my time as a developer. These are just my personal observations on how
developers can work together effectively, build great software, and support each
other's growth. I hope you find them useful.

1.  **Master Your Tools:**

    - Learn your IDE (Vim motions are a must, unless you use emacs!) and become
      a master, as it will improve your development velocity and satisfaction.
      Investing time in mastering your tools will initially feel slow, but the
      long-term gains in efficiency and satisfaction are significant.

2.  **Prioritize Practical Solutions (YAGNI):**

    - Focus on delivering value by prioritizing practical solutions. Not every
      problem requires a complex solution. Remember, Ya Ain't Gonna Need It.
      Identify the likely cases and start there. Just because you can do
      something doesn't mean you should.

3.  **Prioritize Code Reviews:**

    - Prioritize code reviews as a crucial learning opportunity for both the
      reviewer and the author. Remember you are on the hook for the _quality_ of
      the code in PRs. If you don't understand it, ask for clarification. If you
      have concerns, bring them up.

4.  **Foster Psychological Safety:**

    - Always speak up and ensure others feel comfortable speaking up.
      Psychological safety is essential for a healthy and productive team.
      Everyone has a different perspective, and those perspectives are valuable.
      Foster psychological safety by actively listening, respecting different
      opinions, and building a culture of trust.

5.  **Embrace Trade-offs:**

    - Don't assume there is a best way or that your idea is best. There is
      generally not a "right answer" when it comes to design/code, simply
      trade-offs. Remember you all want what's best for the services. Focus on
      the code, not the author. See `Foster Psychological Safety`.

6.  **Abstract Judiciously:**

    - See Go: [Clear is better than clever]. There is no point in being fancy if
      the changes will confuse your coworkers. Remember they have to understand,
      support, and maintain the code as well. Abstract only when necessary to
      improve maintainability or create reusable components.

7.  **Unblock Others:**

    - If you can unblock someone quickly, do it. Being blocked sucks more, and
      if you can spend 5-15 minutes to unblock someone, that pays dividends for
      the team. This is a bit of the golden rule, as you'll benefit if others
      return the favor.

8.  **Iterate in Small Increments:**

    - Iteratively release the smallest change. You'll get faster PR reviews, and
      you'll get better PR reviews as the changes will be easier to review.
      You'll end up making only the necessary changes without introducing
      unnecessary complexity. Your coworkers will thank you for PRs that are
      easier to review.

9.  **Own Your Career:**

    - No one else is or should be as invested in your success as you. Actively
      seek feedback on your weaknesses; they represent your biggest
      opportunities for growth. Always work on filling the role/responsibilities
      one level up. Maintain a record of your work and progress to help
      leadership make cases for your promotion and to hold them accountable.

10. **Own Your Development:**
    - Similar to above, while others can offer guidance, ultimately, your
      development is your responsibility. Seek out a confidant/mentor to act as
      a sounding board and to learn from. Side projects provide valuable
      opportunities to expand your skills and explore new technologies.
